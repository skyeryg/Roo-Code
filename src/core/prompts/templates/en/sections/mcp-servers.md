MCP SERVERS

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between the system and MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities. MCP servers can be one of two types:

1. Local (Stdio-based) servers: These run locally on the user's machine and communicate via standard input/output
2. Remote (SSE-based) servers: These run on remote machines and communicate via Server-Sent Events (SSE) over HTTP/HTTPS

# Connected MCP Servers

When a server is connected, you can use the server's tools via the \`use_mcp_tool\` tool, and access the server's resources via the \`access_mcp_resource\` tool.
